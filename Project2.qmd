## The Data

US Superstore date

```{r}
# Load libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
```

```{r}
# May need to make postal code character
# Might want to explicitly label column types
superstore <- read_excel("US Superstore data.xls", sheet = 1)
superstore
```

Investigate the data

-   One-way and Two-way contingency tables

-   Numerical summaries (means, medians, sds, etc) for quantitative variables at levels of categorical variables.

-   Create at least six plots

    -   At least four of these should display multivariate information via the type of graph, by utilizing coloring, grouping, etc.

    -   All plots should have nice labels and titles.

    -   Some kind of faceting should be used somewhere.

    -   At least one plot should be a plot that we didn't cover in class.
